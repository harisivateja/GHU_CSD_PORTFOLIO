SPEAKER 1: SHASHANK MANCHIKATLA (0:30) - Problem Introduction
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[Navigate to problem.html]

Good [morning/afternoon], I'm Shashank. Today we're presenting the Centralized 
Student Dashboard for Horizon State University.

THE PROBLEM:
• HSU faced below-average retention due to fragmented data systems
• Academic advisors spent 15-20 minutes per student manually querying separate 
  systems for academic, financial, and housing data
• No early warning system existed - interventions were reactive, not proactive
• Different departments used inconsistent risk assessment criteria

This data fragmentation prevented advisors from identifying at-risk students 
before they fell behind.

[Transition]: "Our team developed a comprehensive solution. Hari will explain..."

SPEAKER 2: HARI SIVA SAI TEJA MOGALI (1:00) - Solution Overview
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[Navigate to solution.html]

Thanks Shashank. I'm Hari. We built the Centralized Student Dashboard - 
a full-stack web application that consolidates all student data into one 
actionable platform.

KEY FEATURES:
• Student 360° Profile: Unified view combining academic, financial, housing, 
  and engagement data
• Multi-factor Risk Assessment: Algorithm weighing GPA (40%), Attendance (30%), 
  Engagement (20%), and Financial status (10%)
• Pulse Tracker: Prioritized caseload view for advisors
• Real-time Dashboard: Institutional KPIs and department comparisons

TECHNOLOGY STACK:
• React 19.0 frontend for responsive UI
• FastAPI backend for high-speed async processing  
• MongoDB database for flexible schema management

Our solution shifts advising from reactive remediation to proactive support.

[Transition]: "Manindra will explain our data architecture..."

SPEAKER 3: MANINDRA PORANDLA (1:00) - Data Design
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[Navigate to data.html]

I'm Manindra. Let me walk through our data design.

DATASET OVERVIEW:
• 1,000 synthetic student records across 6 normalized entities
• Entities: Students, Financials, Housing, Enrollments, Courses, Advisors/Alerts
• Student_ID serves as the Foreign Key linking all entities
• Normalized to Third Normal Form (3NF) to eliminate redundancy

[Point to ER Diagram on screen]

DATA GENERATION METHODOLOGY:
• Created programmatically using Python (pandas + faker)
• Realistic distributions: Average GPA 2.77, varied attendance and engagement
• Intentional correlations: Students with low GPA (≤2.5) have higher probability 
  of large outstanding balances
• This correlation testing was essential for validating our risk algorithm

[Transition]: "Now Manohar will show you the live dashboard and key insights..."

SPEAKER 4: MANOHAR NAIDU TALARI (2:00) - Dashboard Demo & Insights
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[Navigate to dashboard.html, then OPEN live dashboard in new tab]

Thanks Manindra. I'm Manohar, and I'll walk you through our live dashboard.

[Show live dashboard: https://harisivasaiteja.github.io/Studentdashboard/]

DASHBOARD FEATURES:
• KPI Cards showing Retention Rate (70.9%), Average GPA (2.77), and 
  At-Risk Students (291)
• Interactive charts tracking GPA trends across departments
• Engagement and housing distribution analytics

[Point to specific charts on screen]

KEY DATA INSIGHTS:
• 29.1% of students identified as at-risk - that's 291 students needing support
• Engineering and Computer Science outperform Psychology and Mathematics in GPA
• Financial stress matters: Students with debt >$15K face DOUBLE the dropout risk
• Scholarships work: They increase retention by 33 percentage points
• Housing impact: On-campus students have 18% higher retention
• Engagement threshold: Scores below 50 predict GPA decline

STAKEHOLDER IMPACT:
• Academic Advisors use 360° profiles for personalized early outreach
• Department Chairs leverage performance data to redesign courses
• Financial Aid Officers target students at risk with strategic aid
• Leadership uses trend data for accreditation and strategic planning

This dashboard enables data-driven decisions instead of reactive interventions.

[Transition]: "Finally, Sandeep will share our lessons learned..."

SPEAKER 5: SANDEEP THOTA (0:30) - Lessons Learned & Conclusion
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[Navigate to lessons.html]

I'm Sandeep. Let me share key lessons from this project:

LESSONS LEARNED:
• Data integration takes TIME - we allocated 40% of development to this phase
• Prioritize value: We focused on MVP features (risk ID + profiles) first, 
  deferred complex automation
• Tech choices matter: Our pivot to React/FastAPI/MongoDB provided better 
  scalability and performance

[Navigate to appendix.html]

NEXT STEPS:
• Production security: JWT authentication and role-based access control
• ML integration: Replace static algorithm with dynamic model trained on 
  historical data
• Action logging: Track advisor interventions and student progress
• Mobile app development for on-the-go access

CONCLUSION:
We've established a 70.9% retention baseline, identified 291 at-risk students, 
and achieved 40% faster data retrieval. This prototype demonstrates how 
predictive analytics can transform student support from reactive to proactive.

Thank you! We're happy to take questions.

[End - Stand ready for Q&A]

PRESENTATION TIPS:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. Practice transitions between speakers - keep them smooth and brief
2. Speaker 4 should pre-load the live dashboard in a separate tab
3. Point to specific elements on screen when referencing data
4. Maintain eye contact with audience, not just the screen
5. Use the website as your visual aid - don't read directly from slides
6. Have backup plan if live dashboard doesn't load (use screenshots)
7. Designate one person to advance pages if presenting together
